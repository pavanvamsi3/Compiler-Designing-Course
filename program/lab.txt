You have to complete all these programs before mid sem. examination which
will be evaluated during this period regularly.

There will be 2 lab. tests before mid sem. examination besides the given
exercise.
The dates of lab. tests will be announced accordingly.

The same pattern will be followed for post-mid sem. lab. for which the

There will be a final lab. exam. along with these 4 lab. tests (2 pre-mid
sem. + 2 post-mid sem.) before end sem. examination.

There will also be a group project whose details will be posted soon.
